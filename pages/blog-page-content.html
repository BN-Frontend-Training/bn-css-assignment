			<h1>Fish and chips</h1>

			<article>
				Classic fish and chips are a British institution and a national dish
				that everyone can't help but love. You can buy them from one of the t
				housands of fish and chip shops all over the country, including the
				world-famous Harry Ramsden'sâ€”or you can make them at home.
				<br>
				Use a thick white fish for this recipe; sustainable cod, haddock,
				or pollock are preferable. The fillets are dipped in a flour batter
				that includes both dark beer and sparkling water, and the carbonation
				ensures a light, crispy fried fish. The "chips" are simply freshly cut
				fried potatoes. Use one pot to fry the chips, then the fish, then the
				chips again (for that crisp exterior and fluffy interior) to ensure both
				fish and chips are ready to eat at the same time. Serve with a pint and
				bring the pub home.

				<h2>Method</h2>
				<h4><b>STEP 1</b></h4>
				<p>
					Cut the potatoes into chips and soak in cold water for 5 mins, then wash until the water runs clear. Tip into a pan
					of cold water with a pinch of salt and 1 tsp vinegar. Bring to a simmer, then turn down the heat and simmer gently
					for 10-12 mins until cooked through but not falling apart. Drain gently, then place on a tray in a single layer and
					chill until needed. Can be prepared a day ahead.

				<h4><b>STEP 2</b></h4>
				<p>
					To make the tartare sauce, chop the cornichons, capers and shallot (finely chop if you prefer a smooth sauce),
					then combine with the parsley, mayo and a pinch of salt. Will keep chilled for up to 24 hours.</p>

				<h4><b>STEP 3</b></h4>
				<p>
					When you're ready to fry, prepare the batter. Tip the flours and turmeric into a bowl with a pinch of salt, pour over
					the beer or fizzy water, and mix quickly until everything just comes together to the consistency of double cream - do
					not over-beat, a few lumps are fine. Keep chilled.
				</p>
			</article>

				<h4><b>STEP 4</b></h4>
				<p>
					Pour the oil into a deep, wide pan like a wok, or heat a deep-fat fryer to 180C. If using a pan or wok,
					ensure that it is no more than two-thirds full with oil. Heat the oil until it is shimmering and carefully 
					lower in the chips using a slotted spoon. Fry for 8-10 mins, gently stirring occasionally until golden and crisp. 
					Transfer to kitchen paper to drain.
				</p>

				<h4><b>STEP 5</b></h4>
				<p>
					Put a little flour in a dish, then bring the oil you used to cook the chips up to 185C, 
					if you have a thermometer, or until a drizzle of batter sizzles and crisps in less than a minute. 
					Working quickly, dust the fish in flour, then dredge through the batter. Hold the fillet above the batter 
					to let the excess drip back into the bowl, then carefully lower into the oil. Fry the fillets for a minute 
					until the batter is just starting to set, then take a spoon and drizzle the fillets with extra batter to create 
					an even crunchier, wispy coating. Fry the fish for about 4 mins, turning once, until deep golden and crisp. 
					Lift onto some kitchen paper to drain for a minute, then serve with the chips, tartare sauce, and plenty of 
					salt and vinegar.
